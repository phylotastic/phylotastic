## June 2018 script 

Hello.  I'd like to illustrate what you can do by going to Phylotastic.org, and clicking the link for Phylotastic web portal, which provides 3 workflows for getting species phylogenies.  

We'll begin by gathering names from a PDF file.  Recently I noticed a paper on the "cetacea", including the whales and porpoises, and their close relationship with the hippopotamus-- a semi-aquatic mammal.  I saved this file earlier as "whales.pdf". 

[when I select to create a list from a document, what happens is that a service provided by the Global Names project is pulling text out of the PDF, finding strings that look like taxonomic names, and then matching those against a database of real names.]

Now, let's choose "Get Tree" to see a phylogeny, which takes a second or two to retrieve and render.  I'm going to click a button to get thumbnail images. [this sends a bunch of queries to the Encyclopedia of Life project which has a lot of nice thumbnail images]
 
Here we have the hippopotamus family.  To find out more, we can take a look at the EOL page.  You can save this tree as an image, or save the Newick string with or without Open Tree IDs.  

Now, let's suppose I want to make this a lesson about the repeated evolution of aquatic mammals, not just the whales and dolphins, but also two other groups, the seals and the manatees.  

First, I will go back to the list we created, and download it.  

Here is the list, with a few names removed to make it shorter. I'll paste in some additional names of species in the two other groups of aquatic mammals.  I'll include the elephant as an outgroup to Sirenia, and I'll mis-spell one name so that I can show you how to fix that later. 

Now, the first time we used the "extract from doc" workflow using a PDF.  This time we will choose the "upload my list" workflow.  The list view has a tab for any unmatched names.  I will fix this one and check again for a match.   

Now we choose "Get tree" again and look at the results.  Up here, with the polar bear and the other carnivores, we have the pinnipedia-- the seals and sea lions. Over here with the hippo, we have the cetacea-- the whales and dolphins.  Down here, with the elephant, we have the sirenia-- dugong and manatee.   

(workflow) Finally, the last workflow begins by naming a group or "taxon", and then specifying a subset.  For instance, let's get a list of all the rodent species for which there is a genome sequence available.  Making a tree with this list is the same as for any other.  

Now, I did all of this without logging in.  My lists and trees will persist as long as my browser remembers this session.  To save your lists and trees long-term, you can log in with your google credentials.  

My name is Arlin.  On behalf of the rest of the phylotastic team, I'd like to thank you for listening.  If you have a comment or question, just click on feedback at the portal.

Hello.  I'd like to illustrate what you can do by going to Phylotastic.org, and clicking the link for Phylotastic web portal, which provides 3 workflows for getting species phylogenies.  

We'll begin by gathering names from a PDF file.  Recently I noticed a paper on the "cetartiodactyla", including the whales and porpoises, and their close relationship with the hippopotamus-- a semi-aquatic mammal.  I saved this file earlier as "whales.pdf" so now I'm going to send it to a name-finding engine Global Names Recognition and Discovery. 

[what's happening now is that GNRD is pulling text out of the PDF, finding strings that look like taxonomic names, and then matching those against a database of real names.]

Now, let's choose "Get Tree" to see a phylogeny, which takes a second or two to load.  I'm going to make a few quick changes to the appearance of the tree and load all the thumbnail images.  

[this is going to the Encyclopedia of Life project to get thumbnail images]

Here we have the hippo, and here we have the group called "cetacea", which I'll highlight.  I'm curious about this species, so I'll take a look at the EOL page for that.  You can save this tree as an image, or save the Newick string with or without Open Tree IDs.  

Now, let's suppose I want to make this a lesson about the repeated evolution of aquatic mammals.  I'm going to go back to the list view and download that list.  

I'll open this list in a text editor and paste in some additional names of species in two other groups of aquatic mammals, the pinnipedia and the sirenia.  I'll include the elephant as an outgroup to Sirenia, and I'll mis-spell one name so that I can show you how to fix that later. 

Now, the first time we used the "scrape names from file" workflow using a PDF.  This time we will choose the "upload list" workflow.  All the names that we entered matched again OpenTree's taxonomy, except the one we mis-spelled.  But we can fix that here and check again for a match.  Got it. 

We choose "Get tree" again and look at the results.  Over here with the hippo, we have the cetacea-- the whales and dolphins.  With the elephant, the sirenia-- dugong and manatee.  With the polar bear, we have the pinnipedia-- the seals and sea lions.  

(workflow) Finally, the last workflow begins by naming a group or "taxon", and then specifying a subset.  For instance, let's get a list of all the rodent species for which there is a genome sequence available.  Making a tree with this list is the same as for any other.

## 2016 script 

Hello.  I'd like to illustrate what you can do by going to Phylotastic.org, and clicking the link for Phylotastic web portal, which provides 3 workflows for getting species phylogenies.  

We'll begin by gathering names from a PDF file.  Recently I noticed a paper on the group of aquatic animals known as the "cetacea", including the whales and porpoises, and their close relationship with the hippopotamus-- a semi-aquatic mammal.  I'm going to look that up on PubMed and use the PDF file as a source of names.  

I'll select this and save it to my desktop as whales.pdf.  This paper has several dozen names of cetacea and other mammals, e.g., humpback whale, hippo, and so on. 

Now, in the phylotastic web portal, you see any of your lists of species on the left, and ways to make a new list on the right.  We'll chose "Extract from doc" and select the whales.pdf file.  

The file is sent to a server that recognizes scientific names.  

Now, let's choose "Get Tree" to see a phylogeny, which takes a second or two to load.  I'm going to make a few quick changes to the appearance of the tree.  

Here we have the hippo, and here we have the group called "cetacea", which I'll highlight.  I'm curious about this species, so I'll take a look at the EOL page for that.  You can also add a photo for each species.   This tree can be saved in an image format and downloaded.  Here is what the tree looks like with half of the images loaded.  

Now, let's take this a bit further.  The cetacea includes whales and porpoises, but not seals.  They actually represent a second group of marine mammals related to carnivora (CIRCLE).  And then there are the manatees and dugongs, a third group.  My colleague Dail made a list of 17 species that illustrates these 3 groups.   

Let's use this list.  I'd like to show you what happens when a name doesn't match, so I'll change Equus caballus to Equus unicornis.  We again go to the menu for creating lists on the right, this time choosing upload list.  I have a file with one name per line, so I choose that.  One of the names didn't match.  Usually this is due to a spelling error, so you have the chance to fix that.  

Now, let's get a tree and look at the results.  Over here with the hippo, we have the cetacea-- the whales and dolphins.  With the elephant, the sirenia-- dugong and manatee.  With the polar bear, we have the pinnipedia-- the seals and sea lions.  

If we load all the pictures, which I'll skip, we'll get something like this-- an excellent way to illustrate the repeated evolution of aquatic mammals.  

(workflow) Finally, the last workflow begins by naming a group or "taxon", and then specifying a subset.  I'll enter Hominoidea and select "known genomes".  The subsequent steps of getting a tree and displaying it are the same.
