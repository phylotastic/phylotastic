# Phylotastic hackathon plan

## location

We chose TN from among the following
* TN - NIMBioS support; central location
* NM - more team members on-site
* MD - too expensive? 
* UIUC - central
* Ann Arbor - get OT people involved

## budget

We put in a budget for this.  This is in the NMSU budget. 

## general plan 

* NESCent hackathon [ENRICO: why NESCent?]
* 4 or 5 days
* 25 people plus locals
* but allow more teams than usual NESCent hackathon? [ENRICO: are we allowing remote participants as we did in some of the others?]

## logistics

* NIMBioS
* 8 to 11 of August, 2017
* will overlap with RevBayes workshop

## email announcement: open call for participation

subject: Apply for the Phylotastic "Trees to go" hackathon, August 8 to 11 at NIMBioS (deadline: 16 June)

We invite interested scientists, programmers and educators to apply for a 4-day hackathon centered on leveraging resources of the Phylotastic project, including its graphical web portal, its suite of web services, and its toolbox code.  

An implicit promise of the Tree of Life project is that, ultimately, expert knowledge of species phylogeny will be accessible and usable by everyone.  The Phylotastic project (http://www.phylotastic.org) aims to meet this challenge with a sustainable ecosystem of open web services providing access to dispersed resources covering the tree of life and related knowledge of taxonomy, characters, and biodiversity.  The system includes over 20 web services for operations such as reconciling names, managing lists of taxa, getting trees, finding images, and so on.  Workflows based on these services can be invoked with toolbox code in various programming languages.  The Phylotastic web portal (access via http://www.phylotastic.org) illustrates on-the-fly delivery of species trees based on web services that extract taxon names from electronic sources, find topologies from available supertrees, scale them by time, harvest images and other data, and render the results graphically.  This tool is suitable for use in developing lesson plans about phylogeny for students in both K-12 and in universities. 

The purpose of the hackathon, which will take place August 8 to 11, 2017 at NIMBioS (Knoxville, TN), is to stimulate further developments that add to this system or leverage it to support research, education, or public appreciation of science.  The targets of the hackathon are not determined in advance: projects and teams will emerge in a bottom-up participatory process.  Examples of suitable projects would be to embed Phylotastic functionality into existing tools (e.g., tree-viewers, apps of any kind that generate or use taxon lists), to build new clients (e.g., phylogeny-learning games, tools to populate EOL taxon pages with trees), to develop classroom exercises, and so on.  We welcome big-picture ideas like developing a system to gather, cross-map and disseminate phyloreferences, or using available tools to evaluate robustness and coverage of OpenTree's resources. 

Whether you are a researcher, a curator, an educator, or something else, we encourage you to apply for participation: our goal is a collaborative environment welcoming the contributions of all.  Support for airfare, lodging and meals will be provided.  To apply, use the online form at http://bit.ly/2qAXuDk to provide brief descriptions of your ideas, your skills and your domain knowledge.  Members of underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Further information is available at http://bit.ly/2pPoyli. Applications are due June 16, 2017. 

We encourage pre-application questions, which may be directed to Arlin Stoltzfus (arlin@umd.edu), Enrico Pontelli (epontell@cs.nmsu.edu), Brian O'Meara (bomeara@utk.edu) or Dmitry Mozzherin (dmozzherin@gmail.com).
