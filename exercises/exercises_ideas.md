# Ideas for educational exercises

AP bio requires phylogeny 

lesson plan, citable, gives credit to teacher

* Classroom lessons, homework, team projects. 

science standards.

contest
* put it on figshare 
* refers to a textbook for supporting information, make sure that each reference includes page numbers, and that there is a complete citation to the textbook including the edition. 


## conversation with an educator, 2/15/2017

past lessons, and ideas for lessons
* in fall, used phylotastic in exercise to curate a walk through a zoo.  student teams choose walk and note species, make tree as part of guide.  this way all the students could produce a tree with the same conventions.  
* in past, created real-time bracketed tournament with TimeTree.  For each competing pair, the winner is the one who gets closest to the TimeTree date of divergence of two species. 
* show that "things that fly" are distributed in various places on tree of life
* draw tree (((A,B),C),(D,E)) and ask students to find species A, B, C, D, E to fit.  Start out with a 20-species tree and choose a satisfactory set of species from that. 
* build tree on the fly, have students call out names in real time to add to tree (needs common name search feature?)
* show convergence or repeated evolution, e.g., aquatic mammals example

bugs and feature requests 
* (emphasized) italicize binomials because I'm trying to teach my students that
* trailing space bug
* capacity to add a branch, e.g., clownfish, dinosaurs.  This can be done in other tools but we need to explain how.  
* add common names to display

notes about the teaching context and what is important
* (emphasized) supporting studies is important.  shows students where the information comes from, allows them to get to source.  I try to get to an alignment as soon as possible, to ask them to see if they can find a synapomorphy (for instance)
* popular INTRO to bio textbook by Campbell has an entire chapter on phylogeny that even refers to likelihood and other methods of inference.  
* FEAR OF LOOKING LIKE A FOOL IN REAL TIME keeps teachers from using software that is glitchy or has unexpected behavior that they do not understand and cannot explain.  I have so many things to teach in a given class that "even a 5-minute setback . . . it's not worth it"
* ON THE OTHER HAND, unexpected outcomes are TEACHABLE MOMENTS IF THE TEACHER KNOWS HOW TO EXPLAIN THEM, e.g., why clownfish is missing, why there are no supporting studies listed

* note to self: glitches in the current system are things like 
   * can't find Nemo in tree (due to Pomacentridae being incertae sedis)
   * some big polytomies (because most of tree is from taxonomy)
   * no supporting studies for some induced trees (because most of tree is from taxonomy)
   * no dinosaurs (because extinct taxa not currently included)
   * no picture from some species in EOL (not sure why this happens)

## ideas about an open call for exercises

Criteria for lesson plans
1. Plans are self-contained, or refer to readily accessible resources.  The plans may refer to a textbook for background or additional information, but must not require a commercial textbook to be useable. 
1. Plans include a description of (a) objectives, (b) target grade level, and (c) the number and duration of sessions.  Cite statewide or nationwide education standards if known.

By entering, you agree that the submitted material is yours to share, and you allow us to make it available with a CC-BY license, so that anyone may use it, so long as they attribute you as the source. 

Criteria for judging

Plans that meet the criteria above will be judged for their likely effectiveness in utilizing interactions with the Phylotastic portal as an integral part of learning about phylogeny, biodiversity, or basic STEM knowledge and skills.

## ideas for exercises 

### US fish & wildlife service 

One example that is very useable is from the US Fish & Wildlife service, e.g., https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/species-listed-by-state-report?state=AL&status=listed

### Marine mammals and semi-aquatic mammals

* Electronic resources 
   * list 1 marine.txt - only pinnipedia, sirenia and cetacea
   * list 2 semiaquatic.txt - semi-aquatic freshwater mammals and non-aquatic relatives
   * list 3 various.txt - a combination of the above two
   * image montages.  Use EOL images. Include closeups of external cranial features, teeth, and limbs. 
      * Pinnipedia (Latin, feather-foot): seals, sea-lions and walruses
      * Sirenia (Latin, siren aka mermaid): sea cows
      * Cetacea (Latin, whale-like): whales, porpoises and dolphins
      * Semi-aquatic mammals: beaver, platypus, hippo, muskrat, aquatic genet
* Exercise 1 
   * show montages for 3 groups of marine mammals. explain a few things.  Sirenia and cetacea spend their entire lives in water, never leaving.  Seals and sea lions are semi-aquatic-- they typically rest, breed, and give birth out of the water.  Most species in all 3 groups are marine, living in saltwater, while there are several dolphins and at least one manatee species (the Amazonian manatee) that live in rivers.  The pinnipedia have whiskers and fur, the sea cows have whiskers but no fur, and the cetacea are completely hairless. 
   * Discussion questions: How do their limbs differ?  How do you think the 3 groups are related?  Why? 
   * Upload list 1 of marine mammals in phylotastic
   * What did you learn? 
* Exercise 2
   * show montages for various freshwater semi-aquatic mammals. Mention a few familiar ones.  Explain that semi-aquatic lifestyles have arisen many times among mammals.  Beavers and muskrats are aquatic rodents.  The platypus is a monotreme.  The hippopotamus is in the same order as horses.  The otter is in the same group as weasels, within the carnivore order that includes dogs and cats. Cats tend to avoid water, but the aquatic genet is a cat that swims underwater and hunts fish.  
   * Discussion question: what will we happen if we upload a list of these semi-aquatic mammals along with various terrestrial relatives?  
   * Upload list 2 of semiaquatic mammals and relatives in phylotastic
   * What did you learn? 
* Exercise 3 (possible homework: run phylotastic and respond to evaluation question)
   * Now we are going to combine all the species and look at how the marine mammals are related to everything else.  What might we find? 
   * Upload list 3 of a broad set of aquatic and terrestrial mammals in phylotastic
   * What did you learn?  

### another one 

go to phylotastic.  choose Nemo.  

Tree ((A,B),C) - find A, B and C
Tree ((A,B),(C,D) - find species

### tree thinking 

make pictures 

## build on available exercises

* tree thinking by Baum, et al: http://www.evolution.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/Basic%20Tree%20Thinking%20Assessment.pdf

### tree thinking 

from assessment, #3: seal, horse, giraffe, hippo, whale 


## strange relations

### bird-dino-crocodilian

can't do this justice due to lack of dinos in opentree.  

can we get them from TreeBase?

## further ideas 

some based on conversation with EJM (6 Feb 2017 AS)

* just find relationships for a set of species.  maybe ask questions along the lines of the tree-thinking questions. 
* aquatic mammals case
   * give list of aquatic, semi-aquatic, non-aquatic
      * get phylogeny
      * answer questions about number of times aquatic habit evolved
   * option: start with matrix of species names, common names, a few traits
      * ask questions about trait evolution 
      * use parsimony 
      * focus on case in which tree will determine which is most parsimonious
   * option: start with some "aquatic habit unknown" and ask students to guess
* whales case
   * load, mark "cetacea".  they would have to read the paper.  

lesson themes
* convergence or parallelism or repeated evolution
   * fish and sharks in the Nemo example
   * different groups of aquatic mammals
* common ancestry
* trait evolution, ancestral states, 
* test knowledge of actual relationships
   * Identify an A, B, C, D such that ((A,B),(C,D)) is true
      * hint: start with a tree with many more than 4 species
   * and other similar tests
