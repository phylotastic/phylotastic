# phylotastic manuscript 1

## Description 

This is not the educational paper or the name-resolution paper.  This is the paper that people will cite when they use our clients or web services as part of the phylotastic system.  

These are the bullet points from our plan devised at the f2f meeting:
* Syst Biol application note
* Soft release to OT and others: 15 Oct
* Initial plan: 15 Oct
* Manuscript: 15 Dec

## Venue

If we don't care about profile, why not aim for a particular audience that we with to target?
* open access
* education journal?  American Education J. 
* community ecology?  
* museum curators? 

If we are targeting educators, curators or community ecologists, it does not make sense to include automated composition as one of the points.  Maybe that should be a separate paper?
